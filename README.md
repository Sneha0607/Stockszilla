# Stockszilla
Stockszilla is a Virtual Stock Market Website created using Django web
framework, in which users can keep an eye on real-time stock
market data and can virtually buy/sell stocks based on their
interests. Users can view graphs of varying scales for each stock and
add them to favourites. All transactions details can be viewed and a
report is generated for each day. A leaderboard is also maintained.
